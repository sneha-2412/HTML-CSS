units:
   units are the measurement needed for a specific property
   i. px(pixels) : pixels are the least basic unit of screen. 
   ii. vh/vw(viewport-height/viewport-width): These measurement uses whole screen as 100%
     100vh --100% of whole screen height
     100vw -- 100% of whole screen width
   iii. %(percentage) : it is used to measure certain percent of parent
   iv.  em(enumerated value): it is x times of parents font-size.
     1em = 1*parent font size
   v.  rem(root enumerated value): it is x times of roots font size
      1 rem = 16px;

use px only few times because it is not responsive


box-model: Any element in HTML is represented as a box. A box contains three properties.
   i border: border is the fence line around the box.
        border: border-width border-style border-color;
        for every border , we can also assign border-radius(corner-radius)
        border-radius: size;
        we can specify border or border-radius to only specific side
        border-left,border-right,border-top,border-bottom,
        border-top-left-radius etc..
    ii. padding: padding means space between border and content of the element
    padding:size;
    padding increases generally height and width. To stop it we can use,
    box-sizing:border-box;

    iii. margin: margin means space outside the box to the other element
      margin:size;

By default, every element contains certain margin and padding. we can stop them by using universal selector(*)
