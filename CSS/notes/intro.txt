CSS:
CSS(Cascading Style Shetts) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearence of web pages. it is used to separate the styles/design from the structure of web page.
It started in 1994.

CSS syntax contains set of rules known as styles, which are applied to elements of the web page . it consists of 
i. selector: it defines what element style will be applied
ii. property: it defines what property to be applied
iii. value : it defines what value for the given property will be applied.
for eg:
        p  ---> selector
        {
            background-color: red; ---> property:value;
        }

CSS Types:
   CSS can be applied to HTML elements in three ways
i. Inline CSS: Defined Directly within the HTML element using style as a attribute
  <element style="property:value....">content</element>

ii. internal CSS: Defined within HTML document using style as a Element.
   we can mention style element anywhere but keeping style at the end of head will give better performance

   <style>
       selector{
        property:value;
       }
   </style>

iii. External CSS: making all styles in HTML file will make file longer and difficult to understand. so, we can use CSS files separately from HTML 
using .css extension

we can link html to external css using link tag. link is a self closing tag
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css file">

content of external file is similar internal css content
  selector{
    property:value
  }

out of all three types Inline is more powerful. 
!important > Inline> Internal=external



Selectors: we can select HTML elements in multiple ways 
  i. tag selector: we can select all elements containg specific tag using tag name as a selector
     tagname{
        property:value;
     }
  ii. class: we can select multiple specific elements containing a classname using class selector. class selector using dot notation
      .classname{
                property:value;
      }
  iii. Id: we can select any one individual element using Id.
  we can represent Id using hash notations
     #id{
        property:value
     }
 
  #id  > .class > tag
