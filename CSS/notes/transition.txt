Transition: Transitions are used to show the transformation of an element from one state to another state 
eg: an element increases its height or an element which changes its position.
  transition: transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function

  transition-property : we can write properties which we neeed to observe transforming its state. or we can mention "all"
  transition-duration : we can mention time in s or ms
  transition-timing-function : we can mention timing functions like
    ease --- grows with gradual speed
    ease-in -- initially slow but later fast
    ease-out -- initially fast but later slow
    ease-in-out -- slow,fast,slow
    linear -- maintains constant speed

we can use multiple proerties for better transitions such as transform,filter,opacity etc..,
  Transform properties contains multiple elements like
    scale -- used for zooming and scale(1) is 100%
    translate -- used for moving the element and translateX(200px) 
    moves the element 200px on X axis
    rotate(deg) -- used for rotating an element
    skew() -- used for dragging element with corners

There are so many filters like grayscale,saturate,blur,opacity,hue-rotate etc..,
