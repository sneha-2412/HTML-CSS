To understand Bootstrap, we need to learn 3 things mainly
i. colors & utitlities:
  Bootstrap provides 8 colors
 primary -- blue color
 secondary -- gray color
 success -- green color
 info -- skyblue color
 danger -- red color
 warning -- yellow color
 dark -- coalblack color

 utitlities: Everything in CSS is possible except 
 pseudoclasses,transition,animations in bootstrap using classnames

 p - padding (pt,pb,px,py,ps,pe)

 d-flex,d-none,d-block,d-inline,d-inline-block etc..,
 gap-0,1,2,3,4,5 , justify-content-center, align-items-center

 2. Grid Layout:
   Bootstrap provides a grid of row with 12 columns
   .row  --- it is used to assign an element as row and it contains 12 columns
   .col -- it is used to assign an element as col and its width is distributed by row
   for eg:
     <div class="row">
        <p class="col">Hi</p>
        <p class="col">Hi</p>
        <p class="col">Hi</p>
     </div>
    In above eg: each p  will get 4 columns space

    .col-colnumber -- it is used to assign an element as column and it s width is distributed as per its number
   for eg: <div class="row">
        <p class="col-6">Hi</p>
        <p class="col-6">Hi</p>
        <p class="col-6">Hi</p>
     </div> 
     In the above eg, row contains two columns width c columns space each and third column will be in 2nd row as 6 columns space

  3. responsiveness:
      Bootstrap is mainly used for responsiveness and it uses certain breakpoints for the responsiveness. Bootstrap follows mobile first design 
      suffix name            width
       ----                   <=576px(used for mobiles)
       sm                      >576px to <=768px (landscape mode)
       md                      >768px to <=992px (tablets)
       lg                      >992px to <=1280px (small laptops, desktop PC)
       xl                      >1280px to 1440px (laptops)
       xxl                     >1400px

  Bootstrap is component library means bootstrap provides ready made component which can be used multiple times whenever we want
