Bootstrap is a css component library.
Library is a pre written code used for specific purposes
for eg: 
some.css
  .x{
    background:red;
  }
  .y{
    background:blue
  }
change HTML as 
  <div class="x">dbvhs</div>


How to use Library?
Every library is nothing but a prewritten code. To import that code or connect that code to our HTML, we need to add CDN link of that particular library
 eg: search cdn link of library-name and get the cdn link and add to link tag as href

Every library uses lot of classnames , so go to that dcoumentation and use its classnames in your code.
