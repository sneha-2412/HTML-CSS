HTML(Hypertext Markup Language):

    web developement started with GML(generalised markup language), later it developed as SGML(standard generalised markup language) and finally in 1992, web starts HTML(hypertext markup language). 
    HTML is used to provide structure/skeleton of the website. It provides all the text,media,forms,button etc.., The current version of HTML is HTML5.
To work with HTML, we need a code editor. Download and install VSCode
  step 1:goto https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  step 2: download 'windows' setup and .exe file will be download
  step 3: double click on downloaded file and next--->next until install -->finish

Everything  in HTML is developed by tags. we can have open tag and close tag
<tagname>   --- open tag
</tagname> --- close tag

whole HTML will be inside <html> and </html>
html contains 2 elements head and body
head contains meta data(data about the data)
head also contain title
body contains actual content of the website

<html>
   <head>
      <title>My First Web Site</title>
   </head>
   <body>
    HEllo world
   </body>
</html>

VScode provides some shortcuts called "emmets"
!+enter or html:5+enter will give basic template of HTML

In HTML, we can mention comments between <!--   and -->. comments are used for better readability of code
