forms are used to collect inputs into webpages from users. 
eg: signin , signup, feedback, suggestion, application,
contact,appraisal form etc..,

   The complete form uses 'form' tag. it contains attributes
like 
  action: contains path to where input details will be submitted

Inputs will be collected using 'input' tag. it is a self closing tag. it contains attributes like
  type: used to define type of input
  placeholder: dummy text placed in input until user inputs a value. used for hints
  value: used to have a value for input by default
  name: used to send the values entered using the name
  id: id is used to identify the input uniquely

      value="prasad" name="na" id="nam" >


label: label is used to define inputs and are connected to inputs by 'for' attribute'
label's for and inputs id should be same
eg: <label for="nam">name</label>

we can wrap whole form within fieldset for a border
and we can use legend for a caption of fieldset
eg: <fieldset>

 <input tyep="text" placeholder="enter name"
