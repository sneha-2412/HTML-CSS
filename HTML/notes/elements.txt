Tag vs Element:
    Tag represent either openeing or closing tags
    but element is complete entity with content
    element = open tag + content + close tag
    eg: <h1> heading </h1> - h1 element

elements in HTML are of two types:
  i. inline elements
  ii. block elements
  Block elements: Block elements always starts in a new line. They won't allow any other elements beside them
  eg: all headings,p, div
  Inline elements: Inline elements will continue the control and they allow other elements beside them
  eg: a,img, span

  div and span are container elements and they are used
  to combine multiple elements.

  Semantic Elements:
     semantic elements are used to make the HTML code more 
 structured and easy to undestand for search engines.
 It is recommanded for better SEO.
 There are so many semantic elements, each serve different purpose
  eg: header, footer,nav,aside,section,article,main,figure etc..,
  non semantic code: 
    <div>  text </div>
  semantic code:
    <section> text </section>

class and Id's:
   class and Id's are the attributes given to a particular 
   element to identify the element.
   classes are used to identify multiple elements at a time
   id is used to identify the element uniquely
   one element can have multiple class names and
   multiple elements can have same class names
   Id's are always unique.
